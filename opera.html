    <h3>H.M.S Pinnafore</h3>
    <h4>Act II, SCENE. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
  discovered singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
  mandolin. LITTLE BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
  him.</h4>
  <p>CAPT. Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
  feel that they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new misery is she referring? Time alone can tell!</p>
  <p>SIR JOSEPH. Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
  daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.</p>
  <p>CAPT. At last my fond hopes are to be crowned. My only daughter is to be the bride of a Cabinet Minister. The prospect is Elysian.(During this
  speech DICK DEADEYE has entered.)</p>
