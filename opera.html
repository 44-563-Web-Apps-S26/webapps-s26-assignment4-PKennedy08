    <h1>Parker Kennedy Light Opera</h1>

    <h3>H.M.S Pinnafore</h3>
    <h2>Act II, SCENE. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
  discovered singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
  mandolin. LITTLE BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
  him.</h2>
  <p>CAPT. Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
  feel that they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new misery is she referring? Time alone can tell!</p>
