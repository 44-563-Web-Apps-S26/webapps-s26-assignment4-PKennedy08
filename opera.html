    <h3>H.M.S Pinnafore</h3>
    <h4>Act II, SCENE. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
  discovered singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
  mandolin. LITTLE BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
  him.</h4>
  <h5> CAPT.</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px"; class="CAPT">Incomprehensible as her utterances are, I nevertheless
  feel that they are dictated by a sincere regard for me. But to what new misery is she referring? Time alone can tell!</p>

  <h5>SIR JOSEPH.</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Captain Corcoran, I am much disappointed with your
  daughter. In fact, I don't think she will do.</p>

  <h5>CAPT.</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px;">At last my fond hopes are to be crowned. My only daughter is to be the bride of a Cabinet Minister. The prospect is Elysian.</p><p>(During this
  speech DICK DEADEYE has entered.)</p>

  <h5>BOTH.</h5>        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">The merry cat-o'-nine-tails and the tar!</p>
  
  <h5>CAPT.</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Dick Deadeye—I thank you for your warning—I will at once take means to arrest their flight. This boat cloak will afford me ample disguise—So!</p> <p>(Envelops himself in a mysterious cloak, holding it before his face.)</p>
  
  <h5>SIR JOSEPH.</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px;">Don't be ashamed of that. Your position as a topman is a very exalted one.</p>

  <h5>Enter JOSEPHINE;</h5> <p style="text-indent: 25px;">she rushes to RALPH'S arm JOS. Darling!</p> <p>(SIR JOSEPH horrified.)</p>
